## Project Overview  
This project explores the **Google Play Store dataset** to analyze app trends, categories, ratings, reviews, and installs. The goal is to uncover insights that can help developers, businesses, and analysts understand what makes an app successful in the competitive app marketplace.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook  

## Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- App names, categories, ratings, reviews, installs, and pricing details  
- Metadata like size, version, and type (free/paid)  

## Key Analysis & Insights  
-  Cleaned and preprocessed dataset (handled missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues)  
-  Identified **top categories** by number of apps and installs  
-  Explored **distribution of ratings** and its relation to reviews and installs  
-  Compared **Free vs. Paid apps** performance  
-  Found trends in **app size, price, and popularity**  
-  Visualized data using interactive and static plots for better storytelling  

##  Sample Visualizations  
- Distribution of Ratings  
- Installs vs. Reviews (correlation)  
- Top 10 Categories by Number of Apps  
- Free vs Paid Apps Rating Comparison  

##  Results / Outcomes  
-  Categories like **Family, Tools, and Games** dominate the Play Store  
-  Higher ratings don’t always guarantee more installs—**marketing and category matter**  
-  Free apps attract more installs, but **paid apps show slightly better average ratings**
